# Coding Challenges

## Challenge #1
Compile and execute the file break.c.  Find out why it's not working as expected and make the necessary correction so that it produces the output below:
````
0-1-2-34567
````
**Hint**: You can stop your program from infinitely looping by pressing `CTRL-C`

## Challenge #2
Create a program that does the following:
1. counts backward from 15 to 5 using a `for` loop
2. counts forward from 5 to 15 using a while loop

## Challenge #3
Create a program that evaluates 2 integers and prints statements to describe their relative values.  The following comparisons should be made:
- Is one bigger than the other?
   - If so, print the statement "the numbers are not equal".
   - Otherwise, print "the numbers are equal"
- Is one even?
   - If so print the statement "at least one number is even"
   - Otherwise do nothing
- Are both negative?
   - If so, print the statement "both numbers are negative"
   - If one is negative print the statement "one number is negative"
   - Otherwise print the statement "neither number is negative"
- Is the first number an even number that is larger than 100?
   - If so, print the statement "the first number is an even number that is greater than 100"
